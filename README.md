# Note Taker

## Description

This Note Taker application allows users to take, view, and delete notes. It uses Espress.js in the back end, saving and retrieving note data from a JSON file. This application was deployed using Render and can be viewed [here](https://note-taker-s49p.onrender.com).

On the right-side of the note-taking page, you are able to type in the title of your note as well as content for your note. Once filled out, the "Save Note" button and the "Clear Form" button will appear.

The "Clear Form" button will clear the right-side of the application and allow you to type a new note.

The "Save Note" button will save your current note to the left-side of the application.

Once a note is saved and appears in the left-side of the application, the user can click on it to view the note. While viewing, a "New Note" button will appear in the top-right corner of the page which will allow users to create a new note. A delete button will also appear next to notes in the left-side of the application which allows users to delete any unwanted notes they may not need anymore.
